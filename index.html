    Tiling Problem
</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Summary</th>
        <td>
            This assignment presents students with a variant of an interactive tiling problem involving multiple constraints. Students are tasked with exploring search trees and traversing search graphs to find solutions using any AI search algorithm of their choice. Additionally, students are encouraged to develop custom heuristics to increase complexity by adversarially tiling the plane.
